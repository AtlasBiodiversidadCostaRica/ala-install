This holds a single play to do a complete setup for the ALA demo platform on CentOS.  

This is a monolithic installation - future iterations might split out roles correctly, to allow for a more sophisticated deployment topology (e.g. roles for cassandra, web, tomcat etc).

Example to run this using a the vagrant and insecure private key:

ansible-playbook -i inventories/vagrant ala-demo.yml --private-key ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key  -u root

For other non-local virtual machines, you'll need to supply an SSH password:


This works on CSIRO VMs......
ansible-playbook -i inventories/demo ala-demo.yml --ask-pass --ask-sudo-pass -s


May need to run

ssh-keyscan ala-lennon.it.csiro.au >> .ssh/known_hosts
