# local artifact directory is used for storing artifacts that 
# are sourced from (e.g.) svn, or ALA maintained URLs that we do 
# not want to include in this build environment.  Typically these 
# are the binaries for the web apps, or pre built indexes that are
# maintained outside of this build.
#
# DM: Ive removed local repo support as this is pretty buggy when not in use  with vagrant
